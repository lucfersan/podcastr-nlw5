## 📚 About The Project

![Podcastr](.github/home.png)
This is an app build in the Next Level Week 5, made by [@Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat).

I chose the React track because I wanted to solidify my knowledge in this technology and learn new concepts that I can apply in my projects.

To connect to an api, this app uses the lib json-server to create a fictitious server in order to focus only on the React library.
